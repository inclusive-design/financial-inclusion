## About this Guidebook

### About this guidebook

While finances may not be something we think about every day, how we live, work, and survive is deeply shaped by our financial situation. This guidebook offers a window into the experiences of people who face barriers when interacting with the financial system and trying to access the resources they need for stability.

It presents tools to help your team expand their understanding of potential clients—especially those often overlooked when financial products and services are designed. Our narratives help build empathy and broaden perspective, while the frameworks support assessment and planning. Each tool can be used on its own or in combination, depending on your team’s needs and goals.

We see this as a living, evolving resource—meant to start conversations and inspire your team to build upon what’s there as people’s needs and contexts continue to shift. We hope the tools in this guidebook spark curiosity, empathy, and a stronger commitment to creating financial systems that are truly inclusive and accessible.

### How this came about

The Inclusive Design Research Centre ran a project called [Partnerships for Financial Inclusion](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/projects/financial-inclusion/), focused on understanding the barriers and approaches that diverse people with disabilities had in accessing financial systems.

Through a series of co-design workshops that were led in collaboration with our community partners, the IDRC team engaged with members of five different community groups who generously shared their experiences  in navigating financial institutions. This largely includes Disabled and Deaf people, as well as members of other historically marginalized groups.

Our team then synthesized the reports, sought feedback from the community leaders, and published a [full in-depth report](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/projects/financial-inclusion/#:~:text=Outcomes). This guidebook is meant to frame those research insights in a way that’s catered to teams who work on financial services and products.

## The Case for Financial Inclusion

### Why are so many people still left out of banking?

As we explore how people interact with financial institutions in Canada, we question

#### Why are nearly 1 million people—3% of Canadians—unbanked?

That means they have no account at any mainstream financial institution. (Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, 2024)

#### Why are almost 5 million people—15% of Canadians—underbanked?

They may have a basic bank account, but can’t rely on it for day-to-day needs, forcing them to turn to payday lenders, cheque cashers, or informal systems. (ACORN Canada, 2023)

#### Why are some groups more excluded than others?

73% of people with disabilities say they’ve faced at least one barrier when interacting with federally regulated organizations like banks (McDiarmid, 2021). People who are low-income, racialized, newcomers, rural residents, seniors, unhoused, or without ID are far more likely to be unbanked or underbanked. (Chollangi, 2022)

These are the same people who often need safe, affordable, and reliable financial services the most. So why aren’t they getting them?

### Why this matters

The number of people facing barriers to the financial system—whether due to disability, low digital literacy, unstable housing, limited ID, or nontraditional income—is not small.

They are not outliers. They represent a significant and growing segment of the Canadian population. When banks overlook these customers in their products, programs, and services, they are not just excluding people—they are walking away from a massive underserved market.

Financial institutions that recognize and remove these barriers can:

#### Expand market reach

Millions remain underserved. Designing with them in mind opens the door to new clients and new forms of value exchange.

#### Build long-term loyalty

People remember how they’re treated—especially in moments of vulnerability. Inclusive service builds trust, retention, and lifetime value.

#### Reduce risk

Regulators and the public are demanding more social responsibility. Exclusion—whether intentional or systemic—can quickly become a legal and reputational liability.

#### Foster innovation

Designing for edge cases often leads to better solutions for everyone. Many now-standard features—like curb cuts or voice assistants—originated from disability-led innovation.

#### Future-proof financial systems

As technology and demographics shift, so do expectations. Institutions that adapt to diverse needs will lead in resilience and relevance.

#### Above all

Inclusive design isn’t about “fixing” people—it’s about fixing systems that weren’t built for everyone. Financial services shape daily life, so making them accessible is not optional—it’s essential.

This is more than a business opportunity. It’s a responsibility. When people are excluded from banking, they lose access to basic tools for stability and participation in society.

Designing for inclusion is an act of dignity. It affirms that everyone deserves a fair chance to build a life of choice, agency, and security. In a world where financial systems define what’s possible, equity isn’t a bonus, it’s justice.
