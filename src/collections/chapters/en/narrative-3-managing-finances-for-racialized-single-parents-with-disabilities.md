  ### The Research

  * Racialized Canadians—about 26% of the population—frequently report poor treatment and bias when dealing with financial institutions. They are more likely to be pitched inappropriate financial products compared to non-racialized customers. _(Share, 2023)_
  * In Canada, about 1 in 3 women experience economic abuse—meaning their partner controls access to money, coerces debt, or sabotages employment. _(Canadian Centre for Financial Well-Being & Economic Abuse Awareness, 2023)_
  * In 2020, nearly 26% of individuals in single-parent families lived on a low income—almost four times the rate for couple families with children. _(Statistics Canada, 2023)_

### Lakshmi, 23 (and Naya, 5)

Surrey, British Columbia {.surtitle}

Lakshmi and her daughter Naya have been living in social housing for a few months now. She immigrated to Canada with her ex-husband, who had complete control over their family finances. After leaving the marriage suddenly, Lakshmi feels relieved to be in a safe and stable home but also overwhelmed. Having a learning disability makes it even more difficult to focus and manage finances on her own.

#### Unexpected events

Lakshmi didn't expect to become a single mother so abruptly. With no Canadian work experience, it's been difficult to find a job or earn enough to meet basic needs.

#### Immigration status and language

Although she's lived in Canada for three years, her husband kept her isolated from the broader community. She had little opportunity to learn English or build connections outside of their cultural group.

#### Cost of living

Even with subsidized rent, managing food, clothing, school supplies for Naya, and other basics is a struggle. Her limited income makes keeping up with the rising cost of living difficult.

#### Stigma and judgment

As a racialized single mother, Lakshmi faces pressure from some family and community members to return to her ex-husband, even though the relationship was harmful.

### Barriers to accessing financial institutions

With help from a community settlement worker, Lakshmi recently opened her first bank account to receive social assistance payments.

She's now responsible for paying bills, budgeting for groceries, and making sure Naya's needs are met—all of which are new and stressful for her. She's hearing about benefit programs and support services from her social worker, but the information is complex and hard to understand.

Meanwhile, some people in her community are warning her against using banks or credit. Still, Lakshmi is considering applying for a secured credit card to help get through this difficult period. She's trying to figure things out on her own, but it feels confusing and overwhelming.

#### Access to **financial management** {.barrier-title}

<div class="two-column flexible barrier">

{% includeSvg "mini-pyramid-management.svg", translations[lang]['mini-pyramid-management-narrative-3'] %}

<div class="flow">

- **The "basics" of financial literacy aren't basic enough:** Lakshmi needs to understand things like different types of bank accounts, how to pay bills, what is a want versus a need, and the very basics of money management.
- **Inaccessible financial education:** Many resources are written generically in ways that aren't trauma-informed, or culturally relevant.
- **Complex and technical language:** Financial agreements are often filled with jargon, making them difficult to understand without a pre-existing grasp on financial language.

### Current & ideal state journey map{.journey-map-title}

#### Scenario

Lakshmi wants to start saving for her daughter's daily expenses. She has some gold jewelry set aside for her, but she's unsure if it will help when it comes to school supplies, camps, or classes.

Her social worker suggests opening a savings account and slowly building her credit.

<div class="journey-map narrative-3">

{% includeSvg "journey-map-narrative-3", translations[lang]["journey-map"], null, false %}

<div class="scenario">

1. In her area, there is no Bank with a teller that speaks her language.
2. At the bank, Lakshmi waits until a female teller is free—she feels more comfortable that way.
3. She says she wants to open a savings account.

</div>

<img src="/assets/images/journey-map-narrative-3-print-page-2.svg" class="print journey-map-page-2 narrative-3" width="236" height="546" />

<div class="usual">

##### What usually happens

1. The teller hands her several forms and points to things on the screen, mentioning fees and interest rates.
2. Lakshmi doesn’t understand but feels too nervous to ask.
3. She’s worried about holding up the line. The words blur together, and she signs the forms quickly, anxious and unsure about what she’s agreed to.

</div>

<div class="potential">

##### What could happen

1. The teller notices Lakshmi’s confusion and kindly invites her to a private booth.
2. They sit down, and the teller gently asks why she wants to open a savings account, to better understand her needs.
3. Realizing Lakshmi is saving for her daughter’s day to day expenses, the teller suggests a high-interest savings account with no annual fees and helps her through the steps.
