### The research

The lack of access to banking services has disproportionate effect on Indigenous peoples. _(Share, 2023)_

On average, people living on First Nation reserves must travel about 25 km to reach a bank (compared to 9km for rural Canadians). _(Chen et al., 2023)_

Only 24% of Indigenous households have access to high-speed internet (compared to 37% of rural households). _(Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, 2022)_

### Althea, 67

_Pond Inlet, Nunavut_

Althea is an Inuk woman living in a small community in Nunuvut. She has low vision due to diabetes and uses a magnifier for reading. She currently relies on her granddaughter and neighbours to help her do admin tasks, as she avoids doing tasks online—both because of the spotty internet coverage in her community, and because she finds most websites inaccessible and hard to navigate.

#### Language

While she can converse in English, she’s much more comfortable talking in Inuktitut, her native language. Reading in English can be challenging, especially since her vision is limited.

#### Social aid policy

She’s on her province’s disability support program, and sometimes makes a little cash on the side playing bingo or other games in her community. While she’s able to work basic jobs, she doesn’t want to risk having additional income compromise her benefits, housing, and other medical support she’s able to get for her disability.

#### Where she lives & cost of living

Living in a remote town in the North means that everything costs more—groceries cost more, items ordered online has a higher shipping cost, and the cost of going to medical appointments (which are more frequent as she ages) is equivalent to the cost of a plane ticket down to a southern province. As she ages, she’s not sure how much she can keep up anymore—especially since disability benefit amounts don’t increase.

### Barriers to accessing financial institutions

She receives her pension and disability benefits via direct deposit but has no access to online banking or mobile apps. In her town, there’s no bank. The only access to banking she has is to an ATM machine at the only grocery store in town, which closes at 6:00 pm. Because she doesn’t have a license, she relies on friends to drive her to the ATM when they’re available, and help her use the ATM to withdraw cash (her community is still very cash-based).

While she is forced to trust her community, she’s always scared of being taken advantage of. What if someone doesn’t give her all of the cash she withdraws from the ATM? What if someone at the till who’s helping her count her money takes a bit more than they should? What if the cab driver charges her more than what the trip costs? What if someone who knows her PIN number uses it?

#### Access to financial touchpoints

- No access to bank branches
- Difficulty accessing ATMs due to grocery store hours
- Difficulty accessing online banking due to internet instability in remote regions and not having regular access to a computer or device.

#### Access to basic financial transactions

- Interacting with ATM needs to be assisted
- Paying with cash needs to be assisted
- Paying at a POS system needs to be assisted
- All of this increases her risk of fraud and scams

### Current & ideal state journey map

#### Scenario

Althea needs cash for her diabetes medication and groceries. It’s icy outside, so she waits all morning for her granddaughter to walk her to the store.

<!-- Flow chart goes here. -->

1. Althea waits for her granddaughter all morning to walk her to the store.
2. Her granddaughter is late and Althea has to rush to the store alone.
3. She arrives just before closing, but the store is already locking up.

##### What usually happens

1. The store owners remind her that the ATM shuts down with the store.
2. Without a debit card that supports audio or large text, she finds the ATM hard to use and feels uncomfortable asking the store owners for help.
3. She feels anxious, dependent, and worried about not having enough cash at hand until the next day.

##### What could happen

1. Althea goes to the ATM, which has recently been moved to a secure, heated booth with 24/7 access.
2. Machine upgraded with large-print screen, tactile buttons, voice guided prompts in Inuktitut and English, and a screen reader mode.
3. She takes out the amount she needs, confidently follows the voice instructions, and is done in minutes. Althea feels proud and independent.
