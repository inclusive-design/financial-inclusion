  ### The Research

  * 21.5% of immigrants in Canada reported having a disability. _(Vergara & Hardy, 2024)_
  * 34-46% of newcomers encounter financial hardship during some point of settlement, despite newcomers who are more highly educated and skilled than ever before. _(Prosper Canada Centre for Financial Literacy, 2015)_
  * Only 31.5% of eligible Canadians (under 60) had a Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) in 2020. Among those eligible but not enrolled in an RDSP, nearly 50% had never heard of it, 46% said they lacked the money to contribute, and 29% reported not having enough information. _(Statistics Canada, 2022)_

### Ki, 49

Halifax, Nova Scotia {.surtitle}

Ki used to run a small restaurant and support his family, including his elderly parents back home. He had a mild heart condition, but he managed it while building a steady life with his wife, Tan, a full-time nurse, and their two kids.

#### Unexpected events

When COVID hit, Ki's health took a serious downturn. He became very ill, and now he lives with post-COVID syndrome, which leaves him constantly fatigued and unable to work. The restaurant had to shut down as he couldn't keep staff on, and he was too sick to keep it going himself. Since then, he hasn't been able to return to any kind of work.

Ki used to send money home to his parents, who rely on him for essentials like medical care. Now, he can't send anything, and they're at risk of losing access to health treatments. This has caused him deep anxiety and distress.

#### Accommodations at work

For a while, CERB and unemployment benefits helped them get by. But those programs have ended, and Tan's nursing income just barely covers their expenses. Because her earnings slightly exceed the eligibility cut-off for their provincial disability program, Ki doesn't qualify—yet they still can't afford basics like medication or physical therapy.

### Barriers to accessing financial institutions

With more than half their income gone, Ki knows he needs to plan for the future—but he doesn't know where to begin. He's unfamiliar with financial tools, and when he tried to speak to someone at the bank, they couldn't offer much help. Nobody mentioned options like wills, insurance, or long-term savings strategies that could help protect his family.

#### Access to **financial advice and planning** {.barrier-title}

<div class="two-column flexible barrier">

{% includeSvg "mini-pyramid-planning.svg", translations[lang]["mini-pyramid-planning-narrative-4"] %}

<div class="flow">

- **Lack of awareness of protective measures:** There can be a lack of awareness about services like wills, life insurance, trust funds, or other programs and services to support one's family and dependents.
This creates a huge gap as people with disabilities and Deaf people tend to live with greater financial uncertainty and with a lot of their income dependent on their caregivers' ability to earn.
- **Lack of awareness of disability-specific financial products:** Although there are several disability-specific investment products for the disability community, such as RDSP, the disability tax credit, and more, many financial advisors at banks are not aware of these products and cannot advise appropriately. This means that many disabled people fall through the cracks, especially when there are cut-off ages for specific products.

### Current & ideal state journey map{.journey-map-title}

#### Scenario

Ki is struggling to adjust after the closure of his restaurant.

Wanting to explore financial options to protect his family's future, Ki books an appointment with a financial advisor at his bank.

<img src="/assets/images/journey-map-narrative-4-print-page-1.svg" class="print journey-map-page-1 narrative-4" width="151" height="479" />

<div class="journey-map narrative-4">

{% includeSvg "journey-map-narrative-4", translations[lang]["journey-map"], null, false %}

<div class="scenario">

1. When booking his appointment, Ki asks if someone understands disability-related financial products. His question is dismissed.
2. In the meeting, he explains his situation to the business account manager.
3. The manager listens and expresses sympathy.

</div>

<img src="/assets/images/journey-map-narrative-4-print-page-2.svg" class="print journey-map-page-2 narrative-4" width="236" height="546" />

<div class="usual">

##### What usually happens

1. However, he says that unless Ki is officially approved for a disability benefit, there's nothing they can offer.
2. Ki asks about flexible loans or savings tools for people with health issues, but the manager is unaware of any such options.
3. Ki leaves feeling discouraged and unseen. He tried to be proactive but found no support.

</div>

<div class="potential">

##### What could happen

1. The manager refers Ki to a disability specialist advisor.
2. The advisor walks Ki through different available options.
   They discuss the pros and cons of each program and how they might meet Ki's needs.
3. Ki takes the information home to discuss with Tan.
   He feels hopeful—like there may be a path forward through this difficult time.

### Exploring possibilities: Quick wins to big moves {.exploring-possibilities}

Here are examples to spark ideas for serving clients like Ki. We use a 2x2 grid to show the scale of effort and impact.

<div class="two-by-two">

<div class="longterm-low">

#### Long term impact, lower effort{.mobile-only}

<div class="card">

##### Make offerings more inclusive

Partner with Deaf and Disabled people to identify gaps in how inclusive current products are, and make changes that serve your full client base—not just the majority.

<div class="longterm-high">

#### Long term impact, higher effort{.mobile-only}

<div class="card">

##### Build upon existing alternative financial models

Learn about and integrate alternative systems like lending circles, mutual aid, and Zakat. These are legitimate and long-standing economic strategies in many immigrant communities.

<div class="quick-low">

#### Quicker impact, lower effort{.mobile-only}

<div class="card">

##### Build trust through people

Hire staff with lived experience of disability. People are more likely to engage and learn from someone who understands their reality and speaks their language, literally and culturally.

#### Quicker impact, higher effort{.mobile-only}

<div class="quick-high">

<div class="card">

##### Train staff on disability specific financial programs

Train staff and advisors on financial supports like the Disability Tax Credit and Registered Disability Savings Plan. Too often, these are unknown or misunderstood even by advisors.
