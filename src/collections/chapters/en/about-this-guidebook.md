While finances may not be something we think about every day, how we live, work, and survive is deeply shaped by our financial situation. This guidebook offers a window into the experiences of people who face barriers when interacting with the financial system and trying to access the resources they need for stability.

It presents tools to help your team expand their understanding of potential clients—especially those often overlooked when financial products and services are designed. Our narratives help build empathy and broaden perspective, while the frameworks support assessment and planning. Each tool can be used on its own or in combination, depending on your team’s needs and goals.

We see this as a living, evolving resource—meant to start conversations and inspire your team to build upon what’s there as people’s needs and contexts continue to shift. We hope the tools in this guidebook spark curiosity, empathy, and a stronger commitment to creating financial systems that are truly inclusive and accessible.

### How this came about

The Inclusive Design Research Centre ran a project called [Partnerships for Financial Inclusion](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/projects/financial-inclusion/), focused on understanding the barriers and approaches that diverse people with disabilities had in accessing financial systems.

Through a series of co-design workshops that were led in collaboration with our community partners, the IDRC team engaged with members of five different community groups who generously shared their experiences  in navigating financial institutions. This largely includes Disabled and Deaf people, as well as members of other historically marginalized groups.

Our team then synthesized the reports, sought feedback from the community leaders, and published a [full in-depth report](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/projects/financial-inclusion/#:~:text=Outcomes). This guidebook is meant to frame those research insights in a way that’s catered to teams who work on financial services and products.
