### Activity 1: Gap mapping

The Guidebook for Financial Inclusion, including activities and worksheets, is available as a [downloadable printable and accessible PDF](/en/download/).{.web}

#### Goal of the activity

This activity will help you think through how accessible a certain offering is to different edge user groups–this could be products like chequing accounts and RRSP's, or services like financial advising. It will help you discover who your offering already works for, and who your edge users are.

#### Who to do this with

You can do this with your team that works on a specific product or service–like financial advising, account opening, or your institution's app.

#### Instructions

<div class="instructions">

1. Pick one offering that your institution provides.
2. Look at the systemic and environmental factors in the Wheel of Financial Stability. Select the factors that may create barriers for your customers to what you are offering.  

   Keep in mind that barriers may be:

   **Physical and environmental:** Can your customers physically access your offering in the environment they have to do it in?

   **Mental:** Do your customers perceive that this offering is for them?

   **Societal:** Do others (tellers, advisors, even family and social networks) perceive that this offering is for your customers?

   - Language 
   - Immigration status
   - Where they live
   - Employment status and accommodations
   - Income and cost of living
   - Savings and unexpected events
   - Stigma and judgment
   - Social aid status
   {.factors-list}

3. Print out the "slices" for each of your factors<span class="web"> (see [file](/en/download))</span>.
4. For each factor, mark down which groups of customers your offering can serve without barriers:

   - {% includeSvg "yes", "" %} Can access your offering
   - {% includeSvg "maybe", "" %} May not be able to access your offering
   - {% includeSvg "no", "" %} Not able to access your offering
   {.yes-maybe-no}

   Remember that when this activity is done internally, it is an assumption (unless backed up by user research). This activity is most effective when done with users who have these life experiences.

#### **Gap Mapping:** Evaluate{.worksheet-title .page-break-before-always}

<div class="instructions">

1. {% includeSvg "connect-the-checkmarks", translations[lang]["connect-the-checkmarks"], "wheel" %}

   <div class="flow">
   
   **Connect the checkmarks**

   By connecting the checkmarks on each “slice” or factor, you can begin to see how inclusive the offering is: the larger the area, the more inclusive your offering, and the better it is at meeting the needs of edge users.
   
   </div>

2. {% includeSvg "connect-the-question-marks", translations[lang]["connect-the-question-marks"], "wheel" %}

   <div class="flow">
   
   **Connect the question marks**

   By connecting the question marks, you can begin to see where customers may not be able to access your offering.
   
   </div>

3. {% includeSvg "notice-the-gap", translations[lang]["notice-the-gap"], "wheel" %}

   <div class="flow">
   
   **Notice your gap and brainstorm**

   The area outside of your shape represents the needs your offering is not able to meet.

   **To make your product more inclusive, brainstorm how you could stretch further to the edges.**
   
   </div>

</div>

##### **Bonus round:** Identifying mismatches between offerings and users{.page-break-before-always}

**Visualizing gaps further**

To see how an offering meets, or fails to meet, the needs of specific edge users, overlay the area that your offering covers with the mapping of one of the narratives. Choose one of the narratives earlier in this guidebook, or create your own through user research.

### Activity 2: Edge User Deep Dive{.page-break-before-always}

#### Goal of the activity

This activity can be used on its own, or as a follow up to the Gap Mapping activity. The Edge User Deep Dive helps you pick one specific edge user group, and think through how much of your services and products they can actually access.

#### Who to do this with

A cross-functional team across the organization, like at a design charette or company-wide conference.

#### Instructions

<div class="instructions">

1. Pick one edge user group to focus on for this activity.
2. Use the worksheet to think through what barriers this user may encounter at each level of the Hierarchy of Needs at Financial Institutions, and ideas on how to remove those barriers.

#### Bonus: Circles of control{.page-break-before-always}

Now that barriers have been identified, it's time to focus on what you can tangibly change. The circles of control will help you articulate what you and your team can change, and what you can't - and therefore what you can focus your efforts and energy on.

##### Instructions

<div class="instructions">

1. Referring to the barriers from the edge user deep dive worksheet, work with yourself or your team to articulate:

   - **What can I or we change?** This can range from small differences in the way you do your tasks, or projects that your team can initiate.
   - **What can I or we influence?** This can include things that you and/ or your team may be able to influence through partnership or allyship with others in your organization, but may not be able to directly change.
   - **What can't I or we change?** These are things, usually larger systems or constraints that you and/or your team can't change.

2. Do this in whatever order feels best or is most productive for your team. There's no hard or fast rule.
3. When you are done, create action items based on what you and/or your team can change, and what you and/or your team can influence.
