### Introducing the narratives

The following four narratives are composites, rooted in real lived experiences. They are tools for designers, researchers, and financial product and services teams to better understand the barriers many of their clients face—and the opportunities for change.

Each narrative connects a personal story to the financial frameworks introduced in this guide, showing both systemic and individual-level challenges. The user journey also shows two realities—one current reality that is blocked by existing barriers, and one alternative reality that imagines a future with greater access. Each narrative ends with practical recommendations, and an activity that challenges you to hold in mind the people in each narrative and look for points of friction or exclusion present in your own services and products.

These narratives reflect just a small part of the diverse needs current and future clients may have. Use them as a starting point to ask questions, seek understanding, and ultimately engage with other perspectives not represented here.
