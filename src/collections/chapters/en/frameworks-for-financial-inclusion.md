### Introducing financial inclusion frameworks

People’s financial states are not only products of their individual action, but often influenced by systemic and environmental factors. Because of this, our narratives demonstrate both barriers at an individual level and a systemic level. We use two frameworks to explain this:

<custom-list>

- {% include "../../../_includes/svg/mini-pyramid.svg" %}

  <div>

  #### Individual level: Hierarchy of needs at Financial Institutions

  This framework explores the different needs individuals have when interacting with financial institutions, and the barriers they encounter at each stage.

  </div>

- {% include "../../../_includes/svg/mini-wheel.svg" %}

  <div>

  #### Systems level: Wheel of Financial stability

  The framework zooms out and consider the wider and interconnected environmental and systemic factors that shape and influence financial interactions.

</custom-list>

### Hierarchy of needs at financial institutions

Inspired by Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, this framework outlines different layers of financial services people need, starting with basic access and moving toward long-term financial planning. Like a foundation, the bottom layers need to be achieved before people can move upward.

<div class="two-column">

{% include "../../../_includes/svg/pyramid.svg" %}

<reversed-list>

1. **Financial advice and planning**<br />
   Barriers to: Disability-specific financial advising, future planning</li>
2. **Financial management**<br />
   Barriers to: Money management, budgeting, using and managing credit
3. **Financial transactions**<br />
   Barriers to: Opening an account, depositing and withdrawing funds, making purchases, POS systems
4. **Financial touchpoints**<br />
   Barriers to: Bank branches, ATM’s, online banking, banking equipment and artifacts

</reversed-list>

</div>

#### Why this matters

This hierarchy highlights not only offers a framework to outline the barriers people face with financial services, it also helps financial institutions build stronger relationships with their clients. Before earning someone’s trust to plan their financial future, you must first ensure they can open an account or even enter a branch.

1. **Establishing loyalty**
2. **Deepening relationship**
3. **Building trust**

</reversed-list>

#### How to use this framework

##### As an assessment tool

Use the framework to evaluate where your current clients face friction in interacting with your products and services. Identify pain points across different levels of access and engagement.

##### As a planning tool

If you're targeting a specific group, use the framework to map their current relationship with your institution. Then, plan how to help them move upward in this model—toward fuller financial inclusion.

### Wheel of financial stability

This wheel demonstrates the systemic and environmental factors that impacts your customers’ ability to achieve financial stability.

#### Factors

Each factor makes up a “slice” of the wheel. Together, all the slices form the full picture.

#### Level of Impact

Each person can be more or less impacted by each factor. The more impacted one is, the more systemic barriers they have against achieving financial stability.

<!-- Wheel diagram goes here. -->

- Where you live
- Stigma and judgement
- Social aid policies
- Cost of living
- Accommodations at work
- Unexpected events
- Language
- Immigration status

#### Breakdown of the different factors

##### Where you live

Where one lives affects their access to essential services, like healthcare and financial services. This also affects their access to affordable essentials, like groceries or household items.

**Least impact:** Urban, suburban

**Some impact:** Rural

**Most impact:** Remote

##### Stigma and judgment

One’s appearance can affect the stigma and judgment others have about them, and can result in being more vulnerable to scammed or refused services.

**Least impact:** Appearing like the majority

**Some impact:** Appearing visibly different than the majority

**Most impact:** Appearing homeless, in a mental health crisis, or visibly disabled

##### Social aid policies

Social aid can have policies that are exclusionary. For example, disability programs limit how much money one can make before they are disqualified. However, this amount often not enough to meet the cost of living.

**Least impact:** Don’t need social aid

**Some impact:** Qualified, but with income capped

**Most impact:** Don’t qualify due to fluctuating income, barrier in applying, or being in a common law relationship

##### Cost of living

Wages are not keeping up with the cost of living. Depending on how much income one makes, they may be more impacted.

**Least impact:** Enough income, plus extra

**Some impact:** Living paycheque to paycheque, no extra savings

**Most impact:** On social aid, no or limited income

##### Employment accommodations

One’s ability to gain and retain employment is subject to whether their employer accommodates their needs.

**Least impact:** Fully accommodated

**Some impact:** Partially accommodated

**Most impact:** Not accommodated

##### Unexpected events

Collective events like the pandemic or a natural disaster, or personal events like a medical emergency can easily throw one off financial stability.

**Least impact:** Have support, funds or income

**Some impact:** Some community and family support, emergency fund or income

**Most impact:** No community, family, and income or emergency fund

##### Language

One’s ability to read and understand the dominant language fluently can affect whether they’re able to understand financial information and navigate the financial system.

**Least impact:** Uses English or French fluently

**Some impact:** Uses English or French partially

**Most impact:** Doesn’t use English or French

##### Immigration status

One’s immigration status can deeply impact their ability to earn money, gain employment, and access capital.

**Least impact:** Citizen, PR

**Some impact:** Temporary visa’s (study, work)

**Most impact:** Refugees, undocumented immigrants

#### Why this matters

A way of understanding exclusion: This framework helps you understand who is likely to encounter the most barriers when dealing with financial institutions. The more impacted they are, the more they are your “edge users”. Based on Inclusive Design principles, solving for the edge will inevitably meet the needs of those in the middle, leading to more innovative, robust, and future-proof solutions.

#### How to use this framework

You can use this as a tool to map how well your products and services are serving these different customer groups—and how far you can make it to the edge. These results can then be used to plan future research and accessibility testing initiatives.
