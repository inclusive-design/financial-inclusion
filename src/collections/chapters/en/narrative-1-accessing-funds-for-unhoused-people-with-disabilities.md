  ### The research

  235,000 people in Canada experience homelessness each year. _(Dionne et. al., 2023)_

  1 in 10 Canadians have experienced hidden homelessness, which means staying in temporary accommodations—like couch surfing, staying with friends or family, or sleeping in cars. _(Ali, 2018)_

  Having two or more disabilities is strongly correlated with hidden homelessness. _(Ali, 2018)_

  Canadians who use antidepressants and other similar medication were two times more likely to experience hidden homelessness. _(Ali, 2018)_

  People who are unhoused have money—they just can’t access it due to barriers with their financial institution. _(Hung et al., 2024)_

### James, 21

_Edmonton, Alberta_

James lives with chronic depression. While some days he can manage his symptoms, other days it’s impossible for him to get out of bed. He’s often called lazy or undisciplined by his family, but he finds it extremely difficult to tell them how his depression makes him feel like he can’t move or speak. What’s even more frustrating is that he wants to get a job and live independently—but he can’t, and that sends him deeper into shame.

#### Unexpected events

James’ mother, who was the only family he had who accepted his sexual orientation, had recently passed away. Since he lived with his mom, he had to move out of their rental—and his other family members wouldn’t take him in. Moving frequently between temporary accommodations, James struggled to maintain stable housing—which continues to send him deeper into depression.

#### Stigma and judgment

Life in shelters means inconsistent access to showers and laundry, and his belongings are often stolen. As a result, James sometimes appears disheveled, which leads to visible judgment and discomfort from others— especially in formal settings like banks, where he feels particularly stigmatized.

#### Accommodations at work

Due to his depression flare ups, James has been unable to hold down full time jobs. He’s tried taking on seasonal or short-term construction work, but it often has rigid schedules that he can’t follow. Flexible jobs are hard to find, especially ones that understand his mental health needs.

#### Social aid benefits

Social services got James on disability benefits. However, when James is able to work, he has to carefully monitor his income to avoid surpassing the earnings threshold that would put his benefits at risk. This low limit discourages him from working more hours, even when he’s able to, and makes it nearly impossible to build up any meaningful savings.

### Barriers to accessing financial institutions

While living in shelters, James had his belongings stolen, including his phone and his wallet, which contained all of his ID, debit card, and credit cards. Without these, he’s unable to access the small amount of money he had saved in his bank account whether through an ATM, at a bank branch, or online.

#### Access to financial touchpoints

- James can’t access ATMs without a debit card
- He faces challenges entering bank branches due to stigma related to his appearance, and he lacks ID and a permanent address, both often required for in-person banking
- He can’t access online banking because he doesn’t have his card number or access to his phone for multi-factor authentication.

#### Access to basic financial transactions

- Because of limited forms of ID, he can’t open bank accounts or open credit products
- Any interaction that requires multi-factor authentication may be difficult as he may not have access to a second device
