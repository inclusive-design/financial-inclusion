### Why are so many people still left out of banking?

As we explore how people interact with financial institutions in Canada, we question

#### Why are nearly 1 million people—3% of Canadians—unbanked?

That means they have no account at any mainstream financial institution. (Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, 2024)

#### Why are almost 5 million people—15% of Canadians—underbanked?

They may have a basic bank account, but can’t rely on it for day-to-day needs, forcing them to turn to payday lenders, cheque cashers, or informal systems. (ACORN Canada, 2023)

#### Why are some groups more excluded than others?

73% of people with disabilities say they’ve faced at least one barrier when interacting with federally regulated organizations like banks (McDiarmid, 2021). People who are low-income, racialized, newcomers, rural residents, seniors, unhoused, or without ID are far more likely to be unbanked or underbanked. (Chollangi, 2022)

These are the same people who often need safe, affordable, and reliable financial services the most. So why aren’t they getting them?

### Why this matters

The number of people facing barriers to the financial system—whether due to disability, low digital literacy, unstable housing, limited ID, or nontraditional income—is not small.

They are not outliers. They represent a significant and growing segment of the Canadian population. When banks overlook these customers in their products, programs, and services, they are not just excluding people—they are walking away from a massive underserved market.

Financial institutions that recognize and remove these barriers can:

#### Expand market reach

Millions remain underserved. Designing with them in mind opens the door to new clients and new forms of value exchange.

#### Build long-term loyalty

People remember how they’re treated—especially in moments of vulnerability. Inclusive service builds trust, retention, and lifetime value.

#### Reduce risk

Regulators and the public are demanding more social responsibility. Exclusion—whether intentional or systemic—can quickly become a legal and reputational liability.

#### Foster innovation

Designing for edge cases often leads to better solutions for everyone. Many now-standard features—like curb cuts or voice assistants—originated from disability-led innovation.

#### Future-proof financial systems

As technology and demographics shift, so do expectations. Institutions that adapt to diverse needs will lead in resilience and relevance.

### Above all

Inclusive design isn’t about “fixing” people—it’s about fixing systems that weren’t built for everyone. Financial services shape daily life, so making them accessible is not optional—it’s essential.

This is more than a business opportunity. It’s a responsibility. When people are excluded from banking, they lose access to basic tools for stability and participation in society.

Designing for inclusion is an act of dignity. It affirms that everyone deserves a fair chance to build a life of choice, agency, and security. In a world where financial systems define what’s possible, equity isn’t a bonus, it’s justice.
